This is a modified version of the SecurityPersonalizer.ino MySensors sketch to work with platformio.
The signing keys (HMAC, AES, SERIAL) are the same that you can find pre-installed in the two MySensors gateways in the d-diot image.
Remember to change them on both sides!!!


Follow this guide https://wiki.d-diot.com/how_to/mysensors/mysbootloader_platformio to configure your PlatformIO installation to support the MYSBootloader.
